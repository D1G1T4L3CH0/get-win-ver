# get-win-ver

Just a simple script to determine the windows version.

You can call this from your own scripts. It sets three variables, **win_v**, **win_v_name**, and **win_v_build**. win-v is the version number #.#. win_v_name is the name of the operating system in a string. win_v_build is the build number.

Feel free to modify this any way you like or just copy/paste it to your own script. Your welcome. :)
